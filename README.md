# ADBMS-Project
Mini Goodreads

We have developed a clone of GoodReads, an application that helps to organize our reading habits. The project gave us a chance to successfully implement various functionalities in [MongoDB](./mini-goodreads-mongo) and [PostgreSQL](./mini-goodreads-postgres) using Node.js as the backend and EJS for frontend. In the databases, we implemented operations like Insert, Delete, Update and various Joins. We then established connections between the backend and the database for these operations. We also established the connection between client and backend to allow the user to perform operations like
